# Ideas to Improve Our Traffic Prediction Script ðŸš€

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I've been thinking about how we can make our traffic prediction script even cooler and beginner-friendly. Here are some friendly suggestions:

1.Keeping Things Fair with Data Splitting:
What if we ensure that our models play with the same set of cards? Moving the data splitting process outside the loop can help each model get a fair share of training and testing data. It's like giving everyone an equal chance to shine!

2. Making Our MLP Model Smarter:
   Let's help our MLP model be a bit more efficient by defining it outside the loop. This small tweak is like giving it a little extra brainpower.

3.Clearer Pictures with Subplots:
Imagine telling a story with picturesâ€”subplots for each junction and model could make our visualizations super easy to follow. It's like creating a comic strip of our model's adventures in predicting traffic!

4.Adding More Friends to the Evaluation Party:
Beyond just checking for mistakes, let's invite more friends to the evaluation party. Accuracy, precision, and recall can join the MAE in giving us a complete picture of how our models are doing. It's like having a team of superheroes instead of just one!
